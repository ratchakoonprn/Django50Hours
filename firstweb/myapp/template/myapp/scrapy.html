  <h3>Scrapy</h3>
  <p> Scrapy (/ˈskreɪpaɪ/ SKRAY-peye) is a free and open-source web-crawling framework written in Python. Originally designed for web scraping, it can also be used to extract data using APIs or as a general-purpose web crawler.[2] It is currently maintained by Scrapinghub Ltd., a web-scraping development and services company.

Scrapy project architecture is built around "spiders", which are self-contained crawlers that are given a set of instructions. Following the spirit of other don't repeat yourself frameworks, such as Django,[3] it makes it easier to build and scale large crawling projects by allowing developers to reuse their code. Scrapy also provides a web-crawling shell, which can be used by developers to test their assumptions on a site’s behavior.[4]

Some well-known companies and products using Scrapy are: Lyst, Parse.ly,Sayone Technologies[8], Sciences Po Medialab, Data.gov.uk’s World Government Data site.</p>
